      <hr />
      <p>
        Rome. Just hearing the name conjures up some of the most famous
        landmarks in the world…the Colosseum, the Sistine Chapel, and the
        Vatican.The history here spans 28 centuries, making Rome one of the
        oldest inhabited cites in Europe (and one of the best places to visit
        in Italy).This city is a wonderful blend of historical sites, charming
        piazzas and neighborhoods, world-class museums, and iconic sites. For
        the first-time visitor, Rome belongs at or near the top of your list.
        It’s a big, bustling city but the main sites are clustered around the
        historic city center.

      <hr />
      <p>
        Without a doubt, Florence (Firenze) is one of the best places to visit
        in Italy.
      </p>
      <p>
        This city was the birthplace of the Renaissance and the art museums
        here are a testament to that. Michelangelo’s David, the amazing Uffizi
        Gallery, the murals inside the dome of the Duomo, and the statues that
        are on display in the historic city center are spectacular sights to
        see. But there are enough towers to climb, gelato to eat, and shops to
        visit that you don’t have to feel like you are on museum overload on a
        visit to Florence.

        Milan is home to the Duomo, world-class museums, trendy shopping
        areas, and Leonardo da Vinci’s “Last Supper.” This city &nbsp; is
        undergoing an architectural Renaissance and it is worth even a few
        hours on the fastest of itineraries.

      <p>
        Venice is one of our favorite spots in Italy. Why?It is small and
        compact, perfect to be explored with just a few days time. Venice is
        romantic, historic, and gorgeous. The canals, the gondolas, the
        architecture, the colorful towns of Murano and Burano…what is not to
        love?
      </p>
      <p>
        Venice is one of the best places to visit in Italy and makes it to the
        top of the list for many first-time visitors.

      <h2 class="lakes">#1Lake Como</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        If celebrity spotting is your passion, Lake Como is the place to go.
        Lake Como has been a tourist magnet starting with the Romans, who
        built the first villas on the lake. Many celebrities have holiday
        homes along the lake – who knows, perhaps you’ll see George Clooney
        out with his twins. But if the lake interests you more, you should
        know it’s one of the deepest in Europe, at 400 meters (1,300 feet).
        Travelers come here for its landscape, explore Villa Carlotta or take
        the tasting gelato in the town of Como. Ferry service links the
        villages along the lake.

      <h2 class="lakes">#2Lake Garda</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Northern Italy’s Lake Garda, which was created by glacial action, is
        the largest lake in Italy. This picturesque lake, bounded by
        mountains, is a popular vacation destination. The lake contains
        several islands, including Isola del Garda where St. Francis of Assisi
        founded a monastery in 1220. The lake itself has a fjord-like quality;
        a ferry makes it fun to travel between the towns on the lake. Orange
        and lemon tree, and olive groves flank its shores, adding a nice
        scenic touch. The lake is popular with bikers, boaters, wind surfers
        and those who prefer to roam the quaint island villages.

      <h2 class="lakes">#3Lake Maggioree</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Lake Maggiore is another lake claimed by two countries, Italy and
        Switzerland, since it forms a border between them. Italy’s second
        largest lake (Maggiore translates as “great lake”) is located on the
        south side of the Alps. It has a Mediterranean climate, making it
        possible to grow exotic plants. The lake is particularly pretty when
        blossoms are blooming on the hills. A good place to view this 64-km
        (40-mile) long lake and its islands is to take the Mottarone cable car
        up the mountains. You can also take a relaxing cruise on the lake or
        even bike around it.

      <h2 class="lakes">#4Lake Orta</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Journalists, from Balzac and Browning to more modern writers, call
        Lake Orta bewitching and a secret gem among northern Italy’s lakes.
        The landscape is indeed beautiful, with the Isla San Guilio
        punctuating it like an exclamation mark. (San Guilio is the patron
        saint of the region.) The island is perfect for strolling, both
        leisurely and romantic, over the cobblestone streets. Be sure to visit
        the 12th century basilica or a colorful market. If it’s serenity
        you’re seeking, end your search at Lake Orta, a sea of tranquility
        nestled among the forests and mountains, about an hour’s drive from
        busy Milan.

      <p>
        Risotto is a typical northern Italian dish that can be cooked in an
        infinite number of ways. Creamy and rich in cheese, it is prepared
        with rice typical of northern areas, such as the Arborio, Carnaroli,
        and Vialone varieties, and cooked slowly in broth.

        Among the most popular is “risotto alla milanese”, which is prepared
        with white wine, Parmesan cheese, butter, onions, and saffron, which
        gives it its unmistakable yellow color. But it can also be made with
        many other ingredients such as pumpkin, red radicchio, mushrooms,
        sausage, or shellfish.

      <h2 class="food">#2Pizza</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Pizza. Inevitable if we speak about Italian food: pizza is a national
        symbol, a food that represents Italy in the world, and has been
        <span><a href="https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/art-of-neapolitan-pizzaiuolo-00722" target="_blank">recognized by
            UNESCO
          </a></span>
        as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Every pizza maker has
        their own secrets and every pizza, made of flour, water, brewer’s
        yeast, and salt, can be stuffed or topped in many different ways. The
        original pizza was created in Naples, in southern Italy, at the end of
        the 18th century in honor of the Queen of Italy, Margherita di Savoia.
        It is presented with a high “cornicione” (the edge) and is lower in
        the center, and is strictly baked in a wood-fired oven. The “pizza
        margherita” is the most famous and simplest of pizzas, with its tomato
        sauce, mozzarella, and basil, recalling the colors of the national
        flag.

      <h2 class="food">#3Pasta</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>
        Another symbol, a national icon, loved all over the world, is pasta. Born in Sicily, in a short time it
        expanded
        its production to other regions by the sea that at the time had ports and an ideal climate for the drying of
        the
        product. Among the most famous areas are Naples and Imperia.

        Rome, however, became the capital of spaghetti, and where “spaghetti alla carbonara” made history. It was born
        almost by chance, from the imagination of a young cook from Bologna, who added bacon with egg yolk, milk,
        cream,
        and cheese.

        <p>
          The recipe has changed little over the years and now includes bacon, egg yolk, and cheese. In the Italian
          capital, they also eat “bucatini al cacio e pepe” made with just butter, pepper, and pecorino cheese.
          The secret is to mix them at the right times. Another famous pasta dish is the “penne all’arrabbiata”—pasta
          with a spicy tomato sauce.

          Yet another classic example of Italian pasta is “tagliatella al ragù”, originally from Bologna, with
          long-cooked meat and tomato sauce.

      <h2 class="food">#4Tortelli and Ravioli</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>
        The family of stuffed pasta in Italy is really very large. From north to south, almost every region has its
        own
        preparation. And many are well known, such as “tortellini” from Emilia, made of pork with prosciutto and
        mortadella, to be eaten in meat broth, and the dry “tortelli,” with a larger rectangular shape, stuffed with
        herbs, pumpkin, or potatoes and served with butter and cheese.
